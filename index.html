        <p class="puns"> The HBO adaptation of The Last of Us has been praised for staying true to the heart of the story, with Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey delivering powerful performances that capture the same emotional weight fans experienced in the game. 
          That said, there are noticeable differences between the two versions. 
          The show often takes a more streamlined approach, focusing on character-driven moments while leaving out some of the smaller details and world-building elements that the game explores in depth.
           Playing the game gives you a broader understanding of the lore — from the origins of the infection to the inner workings of groups like FEDRA, the Fireflies, and even the hostile Hunters. 
           These details, along with countless hidden notes, environmental storytelling, and player discoveries, flesh out the world in ways the show doesn’t always have time to cover.
            Both experiences complement each other, but the game offers a deeper dive into the universe, while the show brings it to life in a more cinematic way. </p><br><br>
